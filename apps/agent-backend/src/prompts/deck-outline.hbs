      "mainPoints": ["tagline", "vision statement"],
      "suggestedVisuals": ["company logo", "hero image"]

      "title": "The Problem We Solve",
      "mainPoints": ["pain point 1", "pain point 2", "pain point 3"],
      "suggestedVisuals": ["problem illustration", "statistics graphic"]
    }
    // ... continue for all slides
  ],
  "narrative": "The overall story arc that connects all slides",
  "keyMessages": ["core message 1", "core message 2", "core message 3"]
}
